Important notice for users of 0.1.11 or lower
=============================================

RbbCode has been updated! The new release (1.x.x)
is not compatible with the old one (0.1.11). If
you want to upgrade to 1.x.x, you'll need to
adjust any calls to RbbCode in your code to match
the new API. For more information:
